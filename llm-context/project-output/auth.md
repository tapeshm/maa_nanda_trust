### Step Logs
#### step-06: Cookie clear utilities (global)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Confirmed clearAllAuthCookies semantics (Max-Age=0 with __Host- flags) and added shared Set-Cookie parser for tests.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/auth/cookies.ts` (no change required)
  - `tests/auth/cookiesClear.test.ts`
- Tests: pass

#### step-07: Per-request auth middleware (verify path; GET vs HTMX)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Implemented requireAuth with cookie-only auth, attaches typed claims, near-expiry marker, and proper unauth responses.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/middleware/auth.ts`
  - `src/types/auth.ts`
  - `src/index.tsx` (wired earlier)
- Tests: `tests/auth/middlewareVerify.test.ts` pass

#### step-08: Single refresh attempt pipeline (race-aware)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Enforced exactly one refresh attempt per request; on 5xx returns 503 (JSON for HTMX), handles already-used and invalid/revoked families.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/middleware/auth.ts`
  - `tests/auth/refreshPipeline.test.ts` (added cases)
- Tests: pass

#### step-09: /logout route (global sign-out)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Best-effort Supabase sign-out, always clears cookies; 302 for non-HTMX and 200 JSON for HTMX.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/routes/logout.ts`
  - `src/index.tsx` (wired earlier)
  - `tests/auth/logoutRoute.test.ts`
- Tests: pass

#### step-10: Rate limiting & precise CORS for auth endpoints
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Rate limiting for /login and /logout; CORS allows only trusted origins with credentials and sets Vary: Origin; correct preflight handling.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts`
  - `src/middleware/cors.ts`
  - `src/index.tsx` (wired earlier)
  - `tests/auth/rateCors.test.ts` (added cases)
- Tests: pass

#### step-11: CSRF protection for state-changing routes
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Double-submit token via `__Host-csrf` issued on login; middleware validates token on state-changing routes.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/middleware/csrf.ts`
  - `src/routes/login.tsx`
  - `src/index.tsx` (wired earlier)
  - `tests/auth/csrf.test.ts`
- Tests: pass

#### step-12: Minimal observability (structured logs; no token contents)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Structured auth events with correlation id; no secrets logged; categorized refresh outcomes.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/observability/authLogs.ts`
  - `src/middleware/auth.ts` (event hooks)
  - `tests/auth/logs.test.ts` (fixed and expanded)
- Tests: pass

#### step-13: Local Supabase dev workaround (HS256 and cookie flags)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: HS256 verification path when DEV_SUPABASE_LOCAL=1 and local SUPABASE_URL; RS256+JWKS otherwise; cookies remain Secure in dev.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/auth/verify.ts` (dev HS256 path)
  - `src/config/supabase.ts` (no change required for this run)
  - `.dev.vars` / `wrangler.jsonc` (no changes required)
  - `tests/auth/devMode.test.ts` (fixed keying; added no-secrets-logged)
- Tests: pass

#### step-14: Role-based route guards (requireAdmin, requireTrustee)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Implemented role extraction and role-based middlewares with HTMX vs full-page semantics; admin implies trustee.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/middleware/auth.ts` (extractRolesFromClaims, requireAdmin, requireTrustee)
  - `src/types/auth.ts` (claims typing used by middleware)
  - `tests/auth/roles.test.ts` (new)
- Tests: pass

### Additional Refactors
- Created `src/utils/env.ts` and `src/utils/request.ts`; removed duplicated helpers across modules; updated imports.
- Normalized Supabase token requests to URL-encoded form body; kept headers centralized via `buildAuthHeaders`.
- Added `tests/utils/http.ts` to consistently parse Set-Cookie headers in tests.
- Updated multiple tests to align with the above and to cover newly added acceptance cases.

### Gates
- Typecheck: repo has pre-existing unrelated issues; changed modules compile under Vitest Workers environment.
- Tests: pass (all auth suites green; 17 files, 77 tests in this run).
- Coverage: not measured in this run.

### Step Logs
#### step-03: JWKS fetcher with edge caching & forced re-fetch
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Implemented JWKS fetcher using caches.default with TTL≤9m and JWT verify with RS256, issuer defaulting to SUPABASE_URL/auth/v1, optional audience, ±60s skew, and one forced JWKS re-fetch on kid/signature mismatch. Added comprehensive unit tests.

  - Tests: pass (6 passed)
  - Coverage: not measured in this run
- Notes: Added a minimal TS augmentation via cast for `caches.default` to satisfy Workers runtime typing without altering global lib types.

### Step Logs
#### step-04: Supabase token exchange utilities and /login route handler
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Added boundary functions `exchangeLogin` and `refreshAccess` calling Supabase `/auth/v1/token` with proper headers and form bodies. Implemented typed error mapping for `invalid_grant` variants (already used, invalid/revoked family) and 5xx retryable errors. Implemented `/login` route that sets both cookies and returns 200 JSON for HTMX or 302 for full-page requests.

  - Typecheck: repo has unrelated type errors; new step-04 modules compile under Vitest environment
- Notes: `.dev.vars` already provided SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY; no changes required in this run.

### Step Logs
#### step-05: /login route handler
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Implemented POST /login to exchange credentials via Supabase, set `__Host-access_token` and `__Host-refresh_token` cookies, return 200 JSON for HTMX/XHR, and 302 for full-page POSTs; no token contents are logged.

### Step Logs
#### step-01: Cookie schema & helpers (`__Host-*`)
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Added secure cookie helpers and TTL env; tests validate flags and TTL override.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/auth/cookies.ts#L1-L82`   <!-- [D3:auth.step-01:cookie-helpers] -->

  - Tests: pass (4 passed)
  - Coverage: not measured in this run
- Notes: Introduced a temporary no-op stub `src/middleware/auth.ts` to unblock Vitest module resolution; it will be replaced in step-07.

### Step Logs
#### step-02: Security headers & cache control
- Result: ✅ Success
- Description: Added CSP builder and global security headers middleware; auth paths return no-store. Wired middleware in app entry. Tests cover HSTS/CSP, auth cache-control, and dev vs prod CSP differences.
- Files Changed:
  - `src/config/csp.ts#L1-L28`   <!-- [D3:auth.step-02:csp-config] -->

### Blocking Issues (present only if the run stopped)
- Unable to run the test gate as required by §9  
  Impact: The spec’s build.test command is ["pnpm","test","--run"], but invoking `pnpm` triggers Corepack to fetch metadata from the npm registry, which is blocked by the environment’s restricted network. Error excerpt: "Error when performing the request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pnpm/latest ... getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN". Attempting to bypass Corepack by running `./node_modules/.bin/vitest --run` also fails due to sandbox exec restrictions ("sandbox denied exec error") after Vitest initializes. Without the ability to run tests, the D3 gates cannot be satisfied, so per §9 and §15 the run must stop before code changes.  
  Proposed Fix: Either (a) allow running tests without Corepack network calls (e.g., permit `./node_modules/.bin/vitest --run` with sufficient exec permissions), or (b) temporarily relax the test gate for this run (not recommended by D3), or (c) update the spec’s build.test to use the local Vitest binary and ensure the sandbox permits its execution.  
  User Escalation: yes
