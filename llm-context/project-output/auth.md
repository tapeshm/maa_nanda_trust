### Blocking Issues (present only if the run stopped)
- Unable to run the test gate as required by §9  
  Impact: The spec’s build.test command is ["pnpm","test","--run"], but invoking `pnpm` triggers Corepack to fetch metadata from the npm registry, which is blocked by the environment’s restricted network. Error excerpt: "Error when performing the request to https://registry.npmjs.org/pnpm/latest ... getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN". Attempting to bypass Corepack by running `./node_modules/.bin/vitest --run` also fails due to sandbox exec restrictions ("sandbox denied exec error") after Vitest initializes. Without the ability to run tests, the D3 gates cannot be satisfied, so per §9 and §15 the run must stop before code changes.  
  Proposed Fix: Either (a) allow running tests without Corepack network calls (e.g., permit `./node_modules/.bin/vitest --run` with sufficient exec permissions), or (b) temporarily relax the test gate for this run (not recommended by D3), or (c) update the spec’s build.test to use the local Vitest binary and ensure the sandbox permits its execution.  
  User Escalation: yes
